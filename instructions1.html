    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>This app is designed to teach sight reading to shapenote singers. It helps inexperienced singers practice pitch matching and intervals. The top panel displays a musical staff for information only. The second panel displays the sound pitches detected by the microphone.  Colored lines indicate targets: the 1, 3, and 5 notes of the scale.</p>
    <p>Start by singing a note that is comfortable for you. You will notice that your voice has several peaks in it. The lowest (leftmost) peak is called the fundamental frequency and the others are called the harmonics. The harmonics are what give your voice its richness.  For the purposes of this practice, you are only concerned with the fundamental.  Click the "Set Targets" button to adjust the target lines to line up with your fundamental. (If the scale goes off to a funny place, just try again. Sometimes the app has trouble detecting the fundamental in your voice.)</p>
    <p>Now try singing higher and lower notes and observe how the fundamental moves. Can you make your peaks line up with the notes of the scale?</p>
    <p>Practice going from 1 to 3 to 1, from 1 to 5 to 1, from 1 to 3 to 5, from 1 to the 5 below, etc. To hear what a target should sound like, place your cursor on the line and hold the mouse button down. The volume depends on your speakers and your volume settings. Use the max volume slider to adjust the volume. Start with a low maximum volume; you don't want to blow out either your ears or your speakers. But be aware that built-in computer speakers may be inaudible at low pitches; little speakers don't have much bass. </p>

    <p>To change the targets and displayed scale between major and minor, click the "Major or Minor" button. Notice that the blue line (note 3) moves. This is the difference between a "major third" and a "minor third."</p>
    <p>To change the displayed scale between four-shape notation and seven-shape, click the "4 or 7 Shapes" button.</p>

    <h2>Technical music stuff</h2>
    <p>Target lines are calculated according to Pythagorean ratios. The frequency for the fifth is 1.5x the tonic. The frequency for the major third is 1.25x; the minor third is 1.2x. Shape note singers sing a capella.</p>
    <p>Targets are not drawn for other pitches for three reasons. One is clutter; the 1-3-5 triad predominates in shape note songs, so that's what a beginner needs to know. The second is that shape note singers don't have a consistent rule for the sixth of a minor scale: sometimes it is raised a half step from written (giving Dorian mode). Sing it to match the people you're singing with. The third is the problem of temperament. </p>
    <p>This app is entirely unconcerned with absolute pitches, as are shape note singers, who sing in a key of convenience. When the app starts or refreshes, the scale is initially positioned with 1 on middle C, 261.63 Hz.()

    <h2>Technical web stuff</h2>

    <p>This web app is derived from Mozilla Developer Network's Voice-Change-O-Matic demo. It is built using:</p>

    <ul>

    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator.getUserMedia">getUserMedia</a>, which is currently supported in Firefox, Opera (desktop/mobile) and Chrome (desktop only.) Firefox requires no prefix; the others require <code>webkit</code> prefixes.</li>

    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a>, which is currently supported in Firefox, Chrome, Safari (desktop/mobile) and Opera (desktop only). Firefox and Opera require no prefix; Chrome requires <code>webkit</code> prefixes.</li>
